# python-projects
3 Python Projects I made while learning python.
1. Command line based tic tac toe
2. A game of war that the computer plays with itself. If it infinitely loops, thats part of the actual card game - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)
3. Command line based game of Black Jack with you vs the dealer

Have Fun!
