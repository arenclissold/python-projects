# python-projects
3 Python Projects I made while learning python. These were my first coding projects back in 2020 🤩

1. Command line based tic tac toe ❌⭕️❌
2. A game of war that the computer plays with itself 👾. Apparently not a very fun game but it was fun to code. If it infinitely loops, thats part of the actual card game - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) 
3. Command line based game of Black Jack with you vs the dealer 🃏

Have Fun!
